CrystalWizard will fill this in....

Step 1:
npm install

Step 2:
edit the following files:
plugin.config.json -- only the name and url need to be changed, and maybe the version
src/code/static.js -- if you need to adjust any file names, do it here
src/code/css/main.css -- the CSS file
src/code/images/ -- these are the image files available for you to change
src/code/strings.json -- the langauge pack for the skin

Step 3:
npx gulp

Step 4:
install, test, go back to step 2... repeat until perfect
